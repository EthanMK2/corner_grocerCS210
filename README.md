This is a C++/Python project I did for a class in my program. It has a simple menu in the console and analyzes files in C++ and particularly Python. 

The part I felt I did well was the Python code. It is the first language I have learned, and it handles files very intuitively. The part I need improvement on is the C++ input and validation. I could not find a good way to validate the input without some weird behavior, but it still works somewhat how it was intended. The hardest code to write was handling the file in C++. I had to look up a video to help explain how to use files and analyze them, and I could see how Python is prefered for analytics. 
The skills of using files, debugging, and looking up documentation is what helped me complete this project. These skills will help me when I move on to more complicated file handling and debugging, especially across two or more languages at once. I am able to transfer these skills to any new task that may come my way. I tried to make this code as transferable as possible by making the functions for Python work for any file in an expected format. I tried to also include some concise comments for those who want to understand the code quickly and effectively.
